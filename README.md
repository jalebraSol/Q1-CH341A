# Q1-CH341A

This repo contains everything I've found online on the CH341A SPI flash EEPROM programmer.  Some files may be duplicated because it I have collected its contents from all over the internet.  It took a lot of research and time to track down all of this so please bear with me.  

Also there are sone PCB files with s .DDB extension which I cant seem to find how to view/open.  Ive found a lot of conflicting information about this and any assistance/tips/info would be greatly appreciated.

includes a clone of the https://github.com/boseji/CH341-Store repo also
